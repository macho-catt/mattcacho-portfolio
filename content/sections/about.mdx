Hello! My name is Matthew, and I'm currently a Broadcast Engineer / IT professional
at KABC-TV. Outside of work, I volunteer with HackForLA, where I lead a team of developers
in the Lucky Parking project and work with PMs, data scientists, researchers, and designers.

My history in software engineering started in college. I studied electrical engineering, but
quickly realized it wasn't for me. At the same time, I took a couple of cs classes and became
interested in programming. However, my dislike for electrical engineering only grew, which indirectly
soured my view of software engineering. Instead, I became interested in security and pivoted to become
an IT professional.

I recently tried another chance at coding and fell in love with it. Now, I try to learn about new
technologies and build fun things on the web.

Since I work with computers a lot, I try to touch grass every weekend and go on long hikes.
Mt. Baldy is my current local favorite!
