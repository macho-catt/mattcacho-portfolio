Visualization of the parking citation tickets in the Los Angeles Metro Area.

My current contributions include implementation of the new header and search component design,
map zoom in/out based on selected area, frontend code bug fixes,
restructuring of the backend code, dockerization of the Node.JS and PostgreSQL for development and data science,
addition of a CD process with GitHub Actions, addition of backend unit testing (to be added to the CI process),
creation of the staging environment, and leading the efforts for restructuring the frontend code and implementation
of a new design.
