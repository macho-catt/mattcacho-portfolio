Hello! My name is Matthew, and I'm currently a Broadcast Engineer / IT professional
at KABC-TV. Outside of work, I volunteer with HackForLA, where I lead a team of developers
in the Lucky Parking project and work with PMs, data scientists, researchers, and designers.

My history in software engineering started in college. While studying Electrical Engineering, I took a couple of
CS classes and became interested in programming. At the same time, cybersecurity became my main interest and eventually
I pursued a career in I.T.

In my second year as a Broadcast Engineer, I started to learn and implement automations using
PowerShell scripting. This reignited my interest in coding as a profession.

Since I work with computers a lot, I try to touch grass every weekend and go on long hikes.
Mt. Baldy is my current local favorite, and my longest day hike so far is the Bright Angel
Trail in Grand Canyon (16 miles)!
