Gyul! Hap! is based on a game from the Korean Show The Genius. It consists of a grid of nine tiles, where each tile is defined by a shape color, shape, and background color.

A "Hap" is a set of three tiles where each property (shape color, shape, background color) is either all the same or all different between the three tiles.

A "Gyul" can be called when all matches have been found (or in a rare instance, there were no matches initially), ending the game.
