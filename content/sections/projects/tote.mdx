Tote (time + quote) displays a changing color background based on the current time
of the day. Each minute, the app displays a new quote.

This app takes advantage of the SSR (server side rendering) feature of Next.js, where
each visit to the page makes an API request to zenquotes.io to retrieve a list
of fifty quotes to cycle from. When the cycle is finished, a new API request is made
to refresh the list.
