Hello! My name is Matthew, and I'm currently a Broadcast Engineer / IT professional
at KABC-TV. Outside of work, I volunteer with HackForLA, where I lead a team of developers
in the Lucky Parking project and work with PMs, data scientists, researchers, and designers.

My history in software engineering started in college. While studying Electrical Engineering, I took a couple of cs classes
and became interested in programming. At the same time, cybersecurity became my main interest and eventually
I pursued a career in I.T.

I recently tried another chance at coding and fell in love with it. Now, I try to learn about new
technologies and build fun things on the web. I am open to new opportunities in Software Engineering,
so chat with me if you're interested.

Since I work with computers a lot, I try to touch grass every weekend and go on long hikes.
Mt. Baldy is my current local favorite!
